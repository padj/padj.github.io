I co-presented this science outreach session alongside Dr. Phil McEwan and Dr. Cerys Mitchell. We presented a look into the use of dynamic transmission modelling to quantify the impact of a zombie outbreak in England as part of the [Oxford Science and Ideas Festival](https://if-oxford.com/events/).

To help explain these concepts, our team put together a regionally-statified SEIR-like model which covers the 412 distinct regions in England. The audience is asked to assume the role of a zombie outbreak decision-makers, voting on which stratgies to adopt to tackle the zombie apocalypse. 

We then relate this to the modelling of real diseases and the decision that must be made.
