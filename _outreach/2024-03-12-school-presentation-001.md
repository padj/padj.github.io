This presentation was designed to inspire Year 12 and 13 students considering STEM careers by sharing my personal journey from aerospace engineering through fish behavior modelling to health data science. The talk emphasized how diverse backgrounds can contribute to solving healthcare challenges.

## Presentation Structure

### The Unexpected Path
- Started with aerospace engineering at University of Leeds
- Discovered the fascinating world of fish behavior during PhD studies
- Demonstrated how skills transfer between seemingly unrelated fields

### From Fish Swimming to Healthcare Systems
The core of the presentation showed surprising parallels between fish behavior modelling and healthcare system analysis:

1. **Individual vs. Population Behavior**
   - How individual fish responses to water flow mirror individual patient responses to treatments
   - Scaling from single entities to large populations

2. **Agent-Based Modelling Applications**
   - Fish navigation through water currents → Patient flow through healthcare systems
   - Schooling behavior → Disease transmission patterns
   - Environmental responses → Healthcare intervention effectiveness

3. **Computational Thinking in Biology and Medicine**
   - Mathematical models as universal tools for understanding complex systems
   - The importance of interdisciplinary approaches

### Interactive Elements

#### "Design Your Fish Pass" Activity
Students worked in teams to optimize a fish passage design using simplified parameters, learning about:
- Trade-offs in engineering design
- How mathematical modelling informs real-world decisions
- The iterative nature of scientific problem-solving

#### Healthcare Challenge Simulation
A brief simulation where students acted as "agents" in a healthcare system, experiencing:
- Resource constraints
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- The complexity of system-level thinking

## Student Engagement

The presentation included several interactive polls and Q&A sessions addressing:

**Career Questions:**
- "What subjects do I need for health data science?"
- "Do I need to be perfect at maths?"
- "What's the job market like?"

**Technical Curiosity:**
- "How accurate are your fish models?"
- "Can you predict the next pandemic?"
- "What's the coolest thing you've discovered?"

## Key Takeaways for Students

1. **STEM careers are diverse**: You don't need to know exactly where you're heading - skills transfer across fields
2. **Biology + Maths = Powerful combination**: Computational approaches are revolutionizing life sciences
3. **Real-world impact**: Data science directly improves people's lives through better healthcare
4. **Interdisciplinary thinking**: The most interesting problems sit at the intersection of multiple fields

## Teacher Feedback

> "The students were completely engaged throughout. Several have already asked about university courses that combine biology and mathematics. The connection between fish and healthcare was brilliant - it really opened their eyes to how transferable scientific skills can be."

> *Sarah Williams, Head of Science*

## Follow-Up Impact

Following the presentation:
- 8 students requested reading lists for health data science
- 3 students arranged work experience placements
- The school invited me back for their annual careers fair
- Two parents contacted me about university pathway advice for their children
