This interactive demonstration was designed to engage festival attendees with the fascinating world of health data science and computational modelling. The presentation combined accessible explanations with hands-on activities to show how data can tell stories about our health and healthcare systems.

## Demonstration Overview

The demonstration featured three main components:

### 1. Healthcare Data Visualization
An interactive display showing real-world health trends using anonymized population data. Visitors could explore:
- Disease prevalence patterns across different age groups
- Seasonal variations in hospital admissions
- The impact of public health interventions on population health metrics

### 2. Agent-Based Modelling Showcase
A simplified version of an agent-based model running in real-time, demonstrating:
- How individual behaviors aggregate to create population-level health patterns
- The spread of infectious diseases through virtual populations
- The effectiveness of different intervention strategies

### 3. Hands-On Activity: "Build Your Own Health System"
Participants worked in teams to design their ideal healthcare system using physical props and constraints, learning about:
- Resource allocation challenges
- Trade-offs between different healthcare priorities
- The complexity of healthcare decision-making

## Key Messages

1. **Data has stories to tell**: Numbers aren't just statistics - they represent real people and real health experiences
2. **Complex systems require sophisticated tools**: Understanding healthcare requires mathematical models and computational approaches
3. **Everyone can contribute**: Health data science benefits from diverse perspectives and interdisciplinary collaboration

## Impact and Engagement

The demonstration attracted over 200 visitors throughout the day, with particularly strong engagement from:
- Secondary school students interested in STEM careers
- Parents seeking to understand health statistics they encounter in media
- Healthcare professionals curious about data science applications

## Materials and Resources

All demonstration materials were designed to be reusable and have since been adapted for:
- School science week presentations
- University open days
- Community group talks

## Future Development

This demonstration format has proven highly effective and is being expanded to include:
- Virtual reality components for exploring 3D health data
- More sophisticated agent-based models with real-time parameter adjustment
- Integration with current health topics and news events
