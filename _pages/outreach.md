I am passionate about sharing scientific knowledge and engaging with diverse audiences beyond the academic community. Through various outreach activities, I aim to make complex data science and health economics concepts accessible to the public and inspire the next generation of researchers.

Public Engagement Activities
======
* **School Visits**: Regular presentations at local secondary schools about careers in data science and health economics, demonstrating how mathematics and computational skills can be applied to improve healthcare outcomes.
* **Science Festivals**: Participation in regional science festivals with interactive demonstrations of agent-based modelling and health system simulations.
* **Community Talks**: Presentations to local community groups about the role of data science in understanding health challenges and informing policy decisions.
* **Online Content**: Development of accessible blog posts and social media content explaining health economics concepts and research findings to general audiences.

Media and Communication
======
* **Podcast Appearances**: Regular guest appearances on healthcare and data science podcasts discussing current research trends and their implications for public health.
* **Expert Commentary**: Providing expert opinions for local and national media on health data trends, particularly relating to population health and healthcare capacity planning.
* **Public Health Campaigns**: Collaboration with public health organizations to communicate research findings that inform health promotion campaigns.

Educational Initiatives
======
* **Mentorship Programs**: Active participation in mentorship schemes for students transitioning from engineering to health data science careers.
* **Workshop Development**: Creation and delivery of workshops on agent-based modelling and health economics for undergraduate and postgraduate students.
* **Open Science Advocacy**: Promotion of open science practices and reproducible research methods through workshops and conference presentations.

Future Outreach Goals
======
I am committed to expanding my outreach activities to reach even broader audiences. Future plans include developing online educational resources, establishing partnerships with local schools for long-term STEM engagement programs, and creating interactive digital tools that allow the public to explore health data concepts firsthand.

If you're interested in collaboration or would like me to speak at your event, please feel free to get in touch.
