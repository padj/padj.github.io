I am very passionate about sharing my enthusiasm for science and modelling. I enjoy the challenge of explaining concepts to individuals and pride myself on my abilities! Through various outreach activities, I am aiming to make complex health and modelling concepts accessible to the public and inspire the next generation of researchers.

Podcast Appearances
======
I am a frequent guest on "Shaping the Future" a podcast hosted by Dr. Phil McEwan and Dr. Marc Evans, which discusses various health and economic topics. As these episodes are released, I'll include links and descriptions here. The podcast will be available on Spotify, Apple music, etc.
