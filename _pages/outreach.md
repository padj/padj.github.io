I love sharing my enthusiasm for science and modelling and enjoy the challenge of explaining concepts to individuals of all backgrounds. Through various outreach activities, I am aiming to make complex health and modelling concepts accessible to the public and inspire the next generation of researchers.

Podcast Appearances
======
In addition to the above outreach activities. I am a frequent guest on "Shaping the Future" a podcast hosted by Dr. Phil McEwan and Dr. Marc Evans, which discusses various health and economic topics. As these episodes are released, I'll include links and descriptions here. The podcast will be available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3NppSSjeJD77YcKqxreOPA), Apple music, etc.

I am committed to expanding my outreach activities to reach even broader audiences. If you're interested in collaboration, or would like me to speak at your school/event, please feel free to get in touch.
