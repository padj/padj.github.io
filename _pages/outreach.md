I am very passionate about sharing my enthusiasm for science and modelling. I enjoy the challenge of explaining concepts to individuals and prode myself on my abilities! Through various outreach activities, I am aiming to make complex health and modelling concepts accessible to the public and inspire the next generation of researchers.

Podcast Appearances
======
I am a frequent guess on "Shaping the Future" a podcast hosted by Dr. Phil McEwan and Dr. Marc Evans, which discusses various health and economic topics.
