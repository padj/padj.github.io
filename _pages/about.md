Hello! My name is Thomas and I'm an principal data scientist at [HEOR](https://heor.co.uk/). I'm an engineer by training, with a PhD in agent-based modelling and computational fluid dynamics. I made the jump from engineering to pharmaceutical data science and health economics in May 2021. My expertise lies in data science, machine learning, numerical modelling, simulation, and optimisation.
