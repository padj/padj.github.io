Hello! My name is Thomas and I'm an principal data scientist at [HEOR](https://heor.co.uk/). I'm an engineer by training, with a PhD in agent-based modelling and computational fluid dynamics. I made the jump from engineering to pharmaceutical data science and health economics in May 2021. 

I have always been curious as to how things work, why things are the way they are, and how things can be improved. This translated into a passion for data and, more importantly, simulation and numerical modelling. That's a very broad field and I'm lucky enough to be employed at a company that supports my desire to work across many different areas and wear many different hats. I enjoy technical work, providing consultancy services, and mentoring/teaching. 

My research interests
======
Professionally, I'm currently working on:
* Machine learning for predicting disease using real world data
* The derivation of risk equations from clinical trial data using using time to event analysis
* Population-level infectious disease & vaccine public health impact modelling
* Financial forecasting for pre-trial assets for launch sequence optimisation
* Patient-level health economic evaluation for obesity and T2DM

I also endeavour to work on personal projects over on my [personal github](https://github.com/padj), and I'm aiming to try and produce blogs posts for each personal project. 

My background
======
I received my undergraduate degree (MEng) in aerospace and aeronautical engineering from the [University of Leeds School of Mechanical Engineering](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering). I then continued to study at postgraduate level, receiving a combined MSc & PhD in computational fluid dynamics and agent-based modelling from the [Centre for Doctoral training in Fluid Dynamics](https://fluid-dynamics.leeds.ac.uk/) at the University of Leeds. My PhD thesis is available to download from the [White Rose eTheses Repository](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/28307/). I went on to have a short stint in academia before joining HEOR in May 2021 as a senior data scientist, before I was promoted to principal data scientist in September 2022.
