This is notes on the future plan of work for blog posts:

1. Health Economic Modelling Series
1.1. Introduction to Health Economics
How do you quantify value & how do you justify costs?
Introduce ICER, CE plane, etc.

1.2. Decision Tree in R

1.3. Partitioned Survival Model in R

1.4. Cohort State Transition Model in R


2. Public Health Modelling Series
2.1. The SIR Model
	Introduction to compartment models
	How to go from conceptualisation to ODE system
	Rates, R_0, R_E, FoI

2.2. Building on the SIR Model
	Adding compartments, SEIR, SEIRD
	Stratifying the population (risk, age)
	Open/Closed populations, background deaths

2.3. Calibrating Compartment Models

2.4. Full Example
	Include treatment
	Include calibration
	Include decision tree for coest effectiveness of treatment


3. Survival Analysis Series
3.1. What is Survival Analysis?
	Censoring, types of censoring
	Survival function, hazard function
	Kaplan-Meier estimator
	Nelson-Altschuler estimator
	Median/Mean survival

3.2. Proportional Hazards Models
	h1(t) = Psi*h0(t)

3.3. Accelerated Failure Time Models

3.4. Fully Parametric Survival Analysis for Health Economic Evaluations


4. ITC series?

5. Machine Learning series?
