This study estimates the economic value of attenuating the rate of decline of eGFR to limit DKD progression. 

We used published estimates of T2D and CKD prevalence, stratified by CKD stage, to develop a deterministic model of DKD. Patient characteristics and mean annual eGFR decline was aligned to the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial placebo arm. Diabetes-specific and all-cause mortality were captured using UKPDS82 risk equations. The value of achieving sustained attenuation of eGFR decline was quantified in terms of costs and QALYs. The findings of our per-patient and population-level analyses emphasise that both patients and the healthcare system benefit from attenuating DKD progression at the earliest opportunity.
