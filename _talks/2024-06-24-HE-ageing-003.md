This study evaluates the population-level effects of excess body weight on US healthcare expenditure via quantification of health economic aging across the population.

This study introduced the concept of a patient's health economic (HE) age. The HE age of an individual with a disease is defined as the average age of a sex-matched person without disease who has equivalent healthcare costs. In this example, the disease is excess body weight measured by BMI, figure 1. This concept is analogous to other biological ages, such as a patient’s heart age. Adults with overweight or obesity were identified from population-level US demographic data contained within the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and their age- and sex-adjusted direct healthcare expenditure was determined based on the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). 

Compared with an ideal body weight (defined as 24 kg/m2), living with excess bodyweight results in an average HE age 8.3 years greater than chronological age (10.5 years females, 4.2 years males). At the population level, this results in a premature HE ageing of 1.34 billion years across the adult population with overweight and obesity. This translates to an annual excess of $299.93B in direct healthcare expenditure ($122.04B in males and $177.90B in females), which would facilitate the treatment of an additional 46 million 60-year-old adults at current levels of healthcare expenditure.
