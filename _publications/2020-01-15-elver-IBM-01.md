This paper presents two models of elver passage through an eel pass; a cellular automata and an individual-based model. Each model was informed by velocities and flow depths predicted by a computational fluid dynamics model. The individual-based model approximates measured passage efficiencies better than the cellular automata. Passage efficiency was greatest for shallow slopes, low discharges and large elvers. The results of this should inform practitioners to improve eel pass designs and installations.
