This study aimed to estimate the effects of the 2022/23 COVID-19 booster program and assessing alternative vaccination strategies on morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 in the UK. An age-, immunity- and risk-stratified SEIR model was used to assess the impact of vaccination on COVID-19-induced hospitalisations, mortality, bed days, and productivity. The model estimated that the autumn 2022/spring 2023 booster campaign resulted in a reduction of 18,921 hospitalizations and 1,463 deaths, compared with a no booster scenario. Utilization of hospital bed days due to COVID-19 decreased after the autumn 2022/spring 2023 booster campaign. Expanding the booster eligibility criteria and improving uptake improved all outcomes, including averting twice as many ICU admissions, preventing more than 20% additional deaths, and a sevenfold reduction in long COVID, compared with the autumn 2022/spring 2023 booster campaign. The number of productive days lost was reduced by fivefold indicating that vaccinating a wider population has a beneficial impact on the morbidities associated with COVID-19.
